### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).


*   **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.

*   **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started the project, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an IDE action.

*   **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).

*   **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.

*   **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

*   **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](
