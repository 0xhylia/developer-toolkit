## Reporting Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously and appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the wider community in identifying and responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities. If you discover any security issues or vulnerabilities in our system, please follow these guidelines to report them:

1. **Privately Notify Us**: Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly before it has been addressed by our team. To report a security issue, send an email to [security@hyperstar.agency	](mailto:security@hyperstar.agency).

2. **Provide Details**: When reporting the vulnerability, please include a detailed description of the issue, including steps to reproduce it if possible. The more information you provide, the easier it will be for us to understand and address the problem.

3. **Responsible Disclosure**: We kindly ask you to give us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address the reported vulnerability before making any information public or sharing it with others.

4. **No Exploitation**: Do not attempt to exploit the vulnerability beyond the minimal level required to prove its existence.

5. **Anonymous Reporting**: If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can use a pseudonym or a temporary email address to report the vulnerability. However, providing a means for us to contact you will be helpful if further clarification is needed.

6. **Response and Acknowledgment**: Our security team will acknowledge the receipt of your report within 48 hours. We will work diligently to investigate, validate, and resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

7. **Credit and Recognition**: Once the vulnerability is verified and addressed, we are open to giving credit and recognition to the reporter if desired. Let us know in your report if you wish to be credited.

Thank you for helping to keep our system secure and for your cooperation in responsible disclosure. Your assistance is essential in maintaining a safe environment for all our users.
